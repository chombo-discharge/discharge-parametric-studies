ExtractElectronPositions — parser for inception-stepper report files.

The chombo-discharge inception stepper writes a space-delimited ``report.txt``
after each simulation run. Each row records scalar and vector quantities for a
given simulation step, including the applied voltage, the peak ionisation
coefficients K(+) and K(-), and the spatial positions of those peaks.

This module provides :func:`parse_report_file`, which reads such a file and
returns the requested columns as a typed list of tuples. It handles:

- Comment lines (``#``-prefixed) used for the column header
- Mixed scalar / vector columns (vectors formatted as ``(x, y, z)``)
- Automatic detection of vector dimensionality from the first data row
- Optional column filtering via the ``interesting`` parameter

Typical usage::

    from ExtractElectronPositions import parse_report_file

    columns, rows = parse_report_file(
        'report.txt',
        interesting=['+/- Voltage', 'Max K(+)', 'Pos. max K(+)'])

def _take_vec(iterator, d):
    """Consume *d* tokens from *iterator* and return them as a float tuple.

    The inception-stepper report file encodes spatial vectors as a sequence of
    whitespace-separated tokens with embedded punctuation, for example a 3-D
    vector ``(1.0, 2.0, 3.0,)`` appears as three adjacent tokens::

        (1.0,   2.0,   3.0,)

    The leading ``(`` is attached to the first token and the trailing ``)`` is
    attached to the last token (which also carries a trailing ``,``).  Interior
    tokens each carry a trailing ``,``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    iterator : iterator of str
        Token stream positioned immediately before the first component of the
        vector.  Exactly *d* tokens are consumed.
    d : int
        Number of components (dimensionality).  Must be greater than 1.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of float
        The *d* floating-point components of the vector.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If *d* is not greater than 1.

    The file mixes comment lines (``#``-prefixed) with space-delimited data
    rows.  The column header is taken from the second-to-last comment block
    preceding the first data row.  Vectors are stored as ``(x, y, z,)``-style
    token sequences; their dimensionality is auto-detected from the first data
    row and assumed to be consistent throughout the file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        Path to the ``report.txt`` file produced by the inception stepper.
    interesting : list of str, optional
        Column names to include in the output.  If ``None``, all columns are
        returned.  Names must match the header strings exactly.

    -------

        file's header and *interesting*).

        One tuple per data row.  Each element is either a ``float`` (scalar
